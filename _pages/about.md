I'm a social psychologist studying how inequalities are reproduced in  organizations and society at large. As a postdoctoral researcher I work with [Prof Michele Gelfand] (https://www.michelegelfand.com/) at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, where I combine large-scale surveys, behavioral experiments, and natural language processing methods to understand how workplace cultures shape the experiences of underrepresented and marginalized employees. I received my Ph.D. in Social Psychology from the University of Melbourne under the mentorship of [Prof Cordelia Fine](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/126041-cordelia-fine) and [Prof Nick Haslam] (https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/6837-nicholas-haslam). 

My research spans both academic and policy domains. Policy-wise, I've led evaluations of gender equality initiatives across government and corporate sectors and analyzed public health data to inform evidence-based interventions. My published academic work examines the factors that motivate and legitimize sexual harassment towards women.
